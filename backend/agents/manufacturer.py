Manufacturability Agent
Assesses whether a compound/protein is feasible for mass production (scale-up).
Analyzes cost, complexity, regulatory path, and production risks.

Key difference from retrosynthesis:
- Retrosynthesis: Lab-scale synthesis (how to make in the lab?)
- Manufacturability: Commercial scale (can we make 1M+ doses/year profitably?)

    Predicts manufacturability and scalability for commercial production.
